# Connect_4_Game
 Coded in assembly language programming in MIPS. a)	The program is a connect four style game. Upon starting the program, the user is asked if he/she wants to play against a computer or another human. If the user chooses to play against a computer, the human player goes first, then the computer. The game continues until either the player wins, the computer wins, or if there is a tie, upon which the program will close. If the user chooses to play against another human, the two players alternate taking turns until one player wins or there is a tie, upon which the program will close. Human players make their moves by entering the number corresponding to the column on the grid. Whenever a player or the computer makes a move, the bitmap display is updated to show the current state of the game board.
